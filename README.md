# Parallel and Distributed Systems
This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Parallel and Distributed Systems. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. Berkley Algorithm
2. Bully Algorithm
3. Using COBRA in Java
4. Remote Procedure Call in Java
5. MultiThreaded Server with locking
6. CUDA
7. MPI usage in Java for parallelism
